\section{Introduction}
\PARstart{D}{ifferential} radar interferometry\cite{Gabriel1989, Massonnet1993,Rosen2000,Bamler1999} is widely used  to monitor and study changes in the natural and built environment. The ability to accurately measure movements along the line of sight over large areas makes them suitable for many  applications. Some examples are the estimation of subsidence rate associated with groundwater or oil extraction and the study of aquifer dynamics\cite{Hudnut1998,Strozzi2001,Galloway2007a}, the monitoring of inflation/deflation connected to volcanic activity\cite{Massonnet1995}, the mapping of ice sheet and glacier motion\cite{Goldstein1993,Mohr1998} , the observation of landslides and instable slopes\cite{Carnec1996,Catani2005} and the measurement of seismic displacements\cite{Massonnet1993b,Zebker1994}.\\
Fully polarimetric radar data provides additional information on the scattering mechanism within each resolution cell, which are employed for classification of the surface cover\cite{Cloude1997, Lee1999}, to extract geophysical parameters such as moisture content\cite{Hajnsek2003} or information on the vegetation \cite{Ulaby1987} or the height of fresh snow\cite{Leinss2014}.\\
The combination of polarimetric and differential interferometric measurement could bring additional benefits for the observation of natural processes; for example by selecting the scattering mechanism that provides the best coherence and thus the least noisy phase measurement\cite{Pipia2009a, Iglesias2014b}.\\
Currently, the majority of radar data employed for differential interferometry is acquired using sensors carried by satellite or aircrafts. These platform are convenient in that they offer a large coverage in a single pass. Nevertheless, because of costs, technical, physical and logistical restrictions, the revisit time of these system is limited to few hours at best. 
In many cases, to better understand the dynamics of natural processes and for real time surveillance and alarming, a denser temporal sampling over longer time spans is desired than the ones afforded by current radar earth observation systems.\\
\subsection{State of the Art}
Several ground based radar systems were developed for these situations, operating in C \cite{Leva2003, Rudolf1999a,Kang2009}, X \cite{Aguasca2004,Pipia2007a} or Ku band \cite{Leva2003, Rudolf1999a,Werner2008, Rodelsperger2012}. The majority of these systems are based on aperture synthesis, using a moving antenna assembly on a motorized rail. 
An alternative to aperture synthesis is to rotationally scan an electrically large fan beam antenna, resolving  scatterers by using its narrow azimuth beam\cite{Werner2008,werner_gpri_2012}. This imaging method has been called type II in \cite{Caduff2015}. 
This configuration has certain advantages over ground-based synthetic aperture systems\cite{Monserrat2014} of comparable rail length: \begin{enumerate*}
  \item Unlike a SAR system, each azimuth sample is 
acquired independently, eliminating the problem of decorrelation caused by moving targets and atmospheric phase screens during the acquisition time. 
These changes destroy the coherence of the scene over the aperture length and will spread these scatterer in azimuth, with a severe impact on image quality, especially regarding the stability of coherent targets.\\
 \item A very large 
angular section can be imaged in a single pass, potentially up to $360^{\circ}$. This is harder to achieve with a rail-based synthetic aperture radar, where usually only a smaller angular sector
can be covered at once.\\
\item An electrically large antenna provides an higher gain and hence a better SNR; this is not the case for  aperture synthesis  where the antenna has to be electrically small to provide a sufficiently wide beam.\\
\end{enumerate*}\\
The majority of polarimetric ground based radar system is based on the aperture synthesis principle. An indoor system is presented in \cite{Bennett1996} followed by a portable outdoors version \cite{Bennett2000}. A broadband polarimetric SAR system with two dimensional aperture synthesis is introduced in \cite{Zhou2004}, with measurement results presented in \cite{Hamasaki2005}.
Another example  of a synthetic aperture system is is UPCs RiskSAR \cite{Iglesias2014, Aguasca2004,Pipia2007a,Pipia2009, Pipia2013,Iglesias2014}. Example of ground based SAR polarimetric data at X and C band are shown in \cite{Kang2009, Kang2010}.\\ A dual polarization, multiband GB-SAR system is used in \cite{Yitayew2014} to produce tomograms of snow covered sea ice. A similar concept is used in\cite{Frey2015,Frey2016} to produce full polarimetric tomograms of a snow pack by synthesizing an aperture in the elevation direction.\\
Much less research is available on real aperture polarimetric systems, excluding non-imaging systems such as ground based scatterometers. One of the few examples is a C-Band version of the GPRI\cite{Cherukumilli2012}.
\subsection{KAPRI: Real Aperture Polarimetric FMCW Radar}
This paper will focus on KAPRI, the Ku-Band Polarimetric Advanced Radar Interferometer (KAPRI). It is an extension of GPRI \cite{werner_gpri_2012,Strozzi2011, Werner2008}, a portable real-aperture, $K_u$ band radar interferometer operating at 17.2 GHz with a wavelength of 1.74 cm, designed 
for the monitoring of unstable slopes using zero baseline differential interferometry \cite{Massonnet1993}. It is equipped with two antennas arranged along a spatial baseline and a dual channel receiver to derive local digital elevation models using single pass interferometric methods.\\
It employs  2 meter long, vertically polarized slotted waveguide antennas, giving the system an azimuth 3dB beamwidth of $0.385^\circ$ and an elevation beamwidth of $35^\circ$.\\
In terms of hardware, the feature distinguishing KAPRI from its predecessor is the addition of horizontally polarized antennas and switches that permit to connect transmitter and receiver to either type of antenna. Together with modifications in the control software, they enable it to acquire a full polarimetric-interferometric dataset by cycling through all the combinations of transmitted and received polarization during the acquisition.

\subsection{Contributions of This Paper}
The following contributions are made in this paper:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Preprocessing methods adapted to KAPRIs hardware are presented, that can be used to generate correct SLC images from the acquired raw data.
	\item A polarimetric calibration model suitable to the systems design is presented, that includes the correction of effects due to differences in polarized antenna design and the presence of spatial baselines between the polarimeteric phase centers.
	\item The validity and quality of the proposed solutions is  quantified by analyzing the response of trihedral corner reflectors in a specifically acquired dataset.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Outline}
Part \ref{sec:methods:signal_model} presents  the methods employed to process the raw data into range compressed SLC. This part includes a derivation of the FMCW signal model and of the acquisition geometry, that will be used throughout the rest of this paper. \autoref{sec:methods:squint_correction} deals with the correction of frequency-dependent beam squint due to the slotted waveguide antenna design. These two sections describe the parts of the processing that are common to both KAPRI and GPRI. The quality of the processing is evaluated in \autoref{sec:results:squint_correction} by plotting the oversampled phase and amplitude response of trihedral corner reflectors, where significant range resolution improvements are observed by applying the described squint compensation procedure.\\
After this step, the range compressed, squint-corrected data shows a residual azimuth phase variation, especially in the VV channel where a linear variation of almost $30^\circ$ is observed inside the antenna beamwidth. This effect is modeled in \autoref{sec:methods:azimuth_processing} as a change in distance between the antennas phase center and the scatterers due to the rotational acquisition geometry. A method to correct it is proposed and tested in \autoref{sec:results:azimuth_processing} on an array of five trihedral corner reflectors.\\ An azimuthal shift between the HH and the VV channel is observed on the  response of point targets along with the phase variationp; it is attributed to misaligned antenna patterns. If left uncorrected, it would cause a reduced power and increased SNR for crosspolar measurements. To remove it, modified antenna mounts that permit to mechanically shifting the antennas mainlobe were manufactured. They are tested in \autoref{sec:results:misalignment} by analyzing the response of a crosspolarizing dihedral reflector acquired with different antenna mounting settings.
The data thus processed is ready for polarimetric calibration; however because KAPRIs employs spatially separated antennas for each polarisation both in transmission and reception, spatial baselines are obtained between certain combinations of channels that cause an additional topographical contribution in the polarimetric phase differences. In \autoref{sec:methods:topo_removal} a method is derived to estimate this contribution using an interferogram obtained from two identically polarized channel on a baseline and rescaled to the undesired polarimetric baseline. Its validity is verified by analyzing the resulting HH-VV phase difference in \autoref{sec:results:topo_removal}.\\
For the polarimetric calibration, a linear distortion model without crosstalk is assumed; the copolar phase and amplitude imbalances are estimated using a trihedral corner reflector, while the imbalance between the crosspolar channel is determined using distributed scatterers assuming reciprocity. Finally, the quality of data calibration is assessed by computing polarization signatures for the trihedral corner reflectors and by estimation calibration model residuals on the reflector array.
