\subsection{FMCW Data Processing}\label{sec:res_SLC}
In order to assess the processing quality and to appreciate the effect of the beam squint correction,  the oversampled impulse response of the TCR at 673 m range is plotted in \autoref{fig:tcr_mph}. No azimuth averaging was applied to this data, to better visualize the effects described above. The plots on the left side (a), and (d) contain the response obtained by range compression of the acquired data without any transformation. The phase displays a cross-like pattern, centered on the maximum, presumably the effect of the frequency-dependent beam squint during the scan.\\ A visual comparison with the responses obtained enabling the squint compensation shows an improvement in range resolution, which is verified numerically by fitting a spline on the range response at the maximum and computing its $3 dB$ width. The azimuth resolution is also estimated in a similar manner.\\ The numerical results are displayed in each plot of \autoref{fig:tcr_mph}.

\subsection{Azimuth Processing}\label{sec:res_azimuth_processing}
The ability of the phase model described in \autoref{sec:azimuth_processing} to explain the phase variation observed on the $VV$ channel response is tested on each reflector in the array: the maximum in range and azimuth was identified and the samples corresponding to the half power beamwidth were extracted at the range of maximum intensity. The unwrapped phase was then used to estimate $r_{ph}$ according to the procedure described in \autoref{eq:rph_estimation}.

	\label{tab:rph_fit}
\end{table}
The resulting model parameters fit values  are shown in \autoref{tab:rph_fit} for the H and V antenna alongside with the distance from the radar and the name of the reflector as defines in \autoref{tab:reflectors}.\\
The result of applying the correction to the TCR "Hindere Chlapf" at 673 m is displayed in panels (c) and (f) of \autoref{fig:tcr_mph}.
In \autoref{fig:phase_response_VV:corrected} the phase and amplitude response in both the HH and VV channel is plotted for all reflectors. To produce the plot, all responses were aligned in azimuth, normalized to the maximum and the phase referenced to the phase at closest approach. In this way, an easier comparison of the azimuthal phase variation is facilitated.

The responses for the HH channel are not plotted because no significant phase trend is observed.}

\subsection{Antenna Pattern Misalingment}

	\label{fig:hv_power}
\end{figure*}
To verify the impact of the H-V pattern pointing shift as described in \autoref{sec:misalingment} on the performance of crosspolar measurements, the response of a dihedral reflector with an high crosspolar contribution is analyzed for two configurations:\\ \begin{enumerate*}\item the case where the antennas are not mechanically moved \item the case where the optimal shift of 1.8 mm, as described in \autoref{sec:misalingment} is applied to the movable antenna hinge to bring the patterns into alignment.\\ 
\end{enumerate*}
In \autoref{fig:hv_power}, the result of the above experiment is shown as the oversampled, coregistered azimuth response in the HV channel.
\subsection{Removal of Topographic Phase}\label{sec:topo_removal}
The removal of the topographic phase contribution in the copolar phase difference, as described in \autoref{sec:topo_removal}, is visualized in  \autoref{fig:topo_phase} by modulating the hue of the image with the HHVV phase difference and its intensity with the corresponding $\mathbf{C}$ matrix element magnitude.

	]{../tab/table_3.csv}
	\caption{Copolar phase ($\phi_r + \phi_t$) and amplitude imbalance ($f$) computed on the reflectors using the calibrated dataset. The polarization purity (VV/HV ratio) is shown additionally. Results for the reflector used to determine calibration parameters are not shown.}
	\label{tab:polcal}
\end{table}		
The methods described in the preceding sections were applied to prepare SLC images for each channel. For the final polarimetric calibration the procedure of \autoref{sec:proc_polcal} was used; one reflector in the scene was used as a calibration target, with the four remaining reflectors used for the determination of the calibration performance.\\
An initial assessment of the data quality is made  by computing polarization signatures\cite{VanZyl1987} for two of the five corner reflectors that were not used to determine the calibration parameters. They are plotted in \autoref{fig:signatures}.
\begin{figure*}[hb]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figure_5}
	\subcaption{Reflector at 673 m.}
	\label{fig:signatures:near}
	\end{subfigure}\\
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{\textwidth}

	\includegraphics{figure_6}
	\subcaption{Reflector at 2690 m.}
	\label{fig:signatures:far}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Polarisation signatures for two trihedral corner reflectors at the locations "Hindere Chlapf" and "T\"{u}rle". For both plots, each panels shows: (a) uncalibrated copolar signature, (b) uncalibrated crosspolar signature; (c) calibrated copolar signature,(d): calibrated crosspolar signature. The power of each response is normalized to the corresponding maxium.}
	\label{fig:signatures}
\end{figure*}

The signature for the uncorrected data does not correspond to the signatures of any basic scattering mechanism. In the calibrated response, both reflectors show a correspondence with the expected polarization signature for trihedral reflectors.\\
\begin{figure*}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figure_8}
	\caption{Dependence of the residual copolar phase and amplitude imbalances on the local incidence angle. The mean and RMS imbalances are shown in each plot. The reflector used for the determination of calibration parameters has been excluded from the plot.}
	\label{fig:inc_angle_trend}
\end{figure*}
A quantitative evaluation of the calibration is obtained by estimating the residual copolar phase and amplitude imbalances $f$ and $\phi_r + \phi_t$ on the trihedral from calibrated data, excluding the reflector used to determine the parameter. The results are shown in \autoref{tab:polcal}. Generally, both the amplitude and the phase imbalance appear to be well corrected. The mean residual for $f$ is 0.97 with an RMS of 0.05. Similarly, for the residual phase difference a mean of $4^\circ$ is observed, with a RMS of $7^\circ$. The biggest outlier for $f$ is represented by reflector "Chutzen", placed very close to the radar, at 73 m slant range. As previously discussed, it is not located sufficiently far away to be in the far field region of the antennas; this could explain the discrepancy from the rest of the array.
In \autoref{fig:inc_angle_trend}, the dependence of the residuals on the local incidence angle is plotted; no clear trend can be distinguished, however it is rather difficult to judge this observation given the small number of data points available and the rather limited extent of covered incidence angles. However, given the small RMS and mean residual errors, the choice of a model that does not consider variation of calibration parameters with incidence angle appears to be justified. The absence of clear incidence-angle related trends is also seen as hinting the appropriateness of the method proposed in \autoref{sec:proc_polcal} to remove the topographic contribution from the polarimetric phase differences: larger variation would otherwise be observed.\\
The assumption of negligible crosstalk seems plausible considering that all reflectors  except the very far one show a polarization purity above 35 dB. In the former case, the combination of large azimuth resolution cell size, the relatively low RCS of the TCR and  the difficulty of exactly pointing it towards the radar may have lowered the purity because of a larger influence of clutter in the cell.
