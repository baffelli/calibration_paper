\subsection{FMCW Data Processing}\label{sec:res_SLC}
In order to assess the processing quality and to appreciate the effect of the beam squint correction, in  \autoref{fig:tcr_mph} the oversampled impulse response of the TCR at 673 m range is plotted. No azimuth averaging was applied to this data, to better visualize the effect of beam squint and its correction. The plots on the left side (a), and (d) contain the response obtained by direct range compression of the acquired data. The phase displays a cross-like pattern, centered on the maximum, presumably the effect of the frequency-dependent beam squint during the scan.\\ A visual comparison with the responses obtained enabling the squint compensation shows an improvement in range resolution, which is verified numerically by fitting a spline on the range response at the maximum and computing its $3 dB$ width. The numerical results are displayed in each plot of \autoref{fig:tcr_mph}; significant improvements in range resolution are noticed after correcting for the frequency-dependent squint. However, a residual azimuthal phase is observed in the VV channel. This ramp is not unique to the particular reflector being analyzed: A linear variation of 30 degrees over the 3dB antenna beamwidth can be observed for all reflectors in the same data, as plotted in \autoref{fig:phase_response_VV:uncorrected}.

\subsection{Azimuth Processing}\label{sec:azimuth_processing}
The residual  azimuth phase observed in the $VV$ channel in \autoref{sec:res_SLC} represents a problem for two main reasons: \begin{enumerate*}
	\item Due to the incoherent phase averagign, it will lead to a reduced amplitude and worse SNR after azimuth presumming. 
  \item as each polarization displays a different ramp, the coherence magnitude of polarimetric phase differences will be reduced and the resulting coherence phase will be affected by a residual phase variation. For example, if the HH-VV phase is needed for calibration in the method described in \autoref{sec:proc_polcal} and the azimuth variation is not taken into account, the additional phase will lead to incorrect calibration parameters.\label{item:phase_variation}\end{enumerate*}\\
The azimuthal phase variation is attributed to the rotational geometry of acquisition: as the antennas are mounted with an  offset $:L_{arm}$ from their center of rotation~\cite{Lee2014}, the distance from the phase center to a scatterer varies with the azimuth position. Geometrically, it can be seen as the phase center moving along a circular trajectory of radius $L_{arm}$. In SAR system the phase variation is exploited to synthesize a large aperture by increasing the antenna beamwidth and the length of the trajectory, so that the illumination time of the point is maximized. In contrast to that case, the illumination time here is to short to allow synthesizing an aperture larger than the antennas physical beamwidth and the only effect of the circular trajectory is the azimuth phase modulation.\\
To model the phase ramp, consider again the radar acquisition geometry of \autoref{fig:real_aperture_signal_model_geometry}:
The antennas are mounted on a lever arm of length $L_{arm} = 0.25$ m that connects them to the azimuth scanner. The phase center of the antenna is horizontally displaced from the lever arm attachment by $L_{ph}$, this parameter allows to model physical differences between the antennas. A point target is considered, located at the  range of closest approach $R_{0}$, obtained when the phase center, the target and the lever arm all lie on the same line. When the antenna is rotated by $\theta_r$ relative to the situation of closest approach, the phase changes as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:range_phase}
	\phi_{scan} = \frac{4 \pi}{\lambda}R\left(\theta_r\right).
\end{equation}
Where $R$ is the effective distance between the point target and the phase center.
To compute $R$, the law of cosines is applied to the triangle of~\autoref{fig:real_aperture_signal_model_geometry}, with the included angle $\theta_r$, one side length $L_{ant} = \sqrt{L_{arm}^2 + L_{ph}^2}$ and the other side $c = L_{ant} + R_0$.  $L_{ant}$ is the equivalent antenna rotation arm for a system with no phase center shift.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:range}
	R = \sqrt{ c^2 +  L_{ant}^2 - 2 c L_{ant} \cos{\left(\theta_r - \alpha\right)}}.
\end{equation}
The function is shifted by the angle  $\alpha = \operatorname{\arctan}\left({\frac{L_{ph}}{L_{arm}}}\right)$ that describes the additional rotation needed for an antenna with nonzero $L_{ph}$ to be at closest approach. This shift is necessary because the azimuth angle is measured assuming a zero $L_{ph}$: the reading given by the angle encoder of  the azimuth scanner does not correspond to the azimuth of the phase center.\\
As seen in \autoref{eq:range}, the distance of each scatterer is a function of the relative rotation angle $\theta_r$ of the antenna. Thus azimuth and distance are coupled, an effect know as Range Cell Migration . In this case, the range resolution is significantly smaller than the amount of RCM and only effect of the rotation on the phase (\autoref{eq:range_phase}) needs to be considered.\\
The complete characterization of the azimuth phase requires the knowledge of the antenna phase center displacement $L_{ph}$. This value is generally not known a priori; normally it is assumed that the phase center at the midpoint of the antenna length. However, when the experimental data was analyzed using this assumption (which implies $L_{ant} = L_{arm}$),  \autoref{eq:range} failed to model the observed azimuth phase variation. The model was extended to account for the possibility of a displaced antenna phase center. $L_{ph}$ is estimated using the measured phase of a point target by minimizing the squared distance between it an the phase simulated according to \autoref{eq:range}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rph_estimation}
	\hat{r_{ph}} = \underset{\left(L_{ph}, \phi_{off}\right)}{\operatorname{argmax}}{\vert\vert\phi_{meas} - \phi_{sim}\vert\vert}^2.
\end{equation}
Where $\phi_{sim} = \phi_{scan} + \phi_{off}$ is the simulated phase with an additional offset that accounts for the phase induced by the noise, the intrinsic scattering phase and the system.\\
The model was tested on each reflector of the array: the maximum in range and azimuth was identified and the samples corresponding to the half power beamwidth were extracted at the range of maximum intensity. The unwrapped phase was then used to estimate $r_{ph}$ according to the procedure described in \autoref{eq:rph_estimation}.

	\caption{Result of the phase center displacement fit for six trihedral corner reflectors located at different ranges.}
	\label{tab:rph_fit}
\end{table}
The resulting model parameters fit values  are shown in \autoref{tab:rph_fit}; they appear to be consistent and display a standard deviation of less than 2 \% of the antenna length, suggesting that the model is able to predict most of the phase variation.\\
When $L_{ph}$ has been estimated, the azimuth phase variation is corrected using \autoref{eq:range} as a matched filter. Each azimuth line in the range compressed, desquinted data $s_{d}$ is corrected using:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correction}
	\begin{aligned}
		s_{d}^{corr}\left(\theta, R_{0}\right) = &\int\limits_{-\frac{\theta_{int}}{2}}^{\frac{\theta_{int}}{2}}e^{\jmath \frac{4\pi}{\lambda}\left(R\left(\theta - \theta^{\prime}, R_{0}\right) - R_{0}\right)}\\
		&s_{d}\left(\theta^\prime\right) d\theta^\prime,
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The formula replaces the azimuth averaging described in \autoref{sec:proc_SLC}: the samples are now averaged with the appropriate phase factor so that the SNR improvement and the correction of the azimuth trend are combined in a single step. Usually, after convolution only the central pixel of the integration window is kept to reduce the amount of data, as the original acquisition is always oversampled in azimuth. In the filter, the phase at closest approach $R_{0}$ is subtracted from the current modeled phase to correct the relative phase variation only; this is important for interferometric processing where the absolute phase has to be preserved.\\
The procedure is similar to azimuth focusing of synthetic aperture data, where the cross-range resolution is obtained by the integration of the data in the azimuth-time direction. However, in the case of real aperture systems the resolution is limited by physical antenna beamwidth and the response of a target  occupies a single azimuth sample; unless the data is oversampled. In the first case, integrating the data in azimuth degrades the resolution because samples that do represent the same scatterer are combined.\\ To correct the phase variation without an excessive increase in azimuth resolution, the integration is limited to a window of size $\theta_{int}$. The optimal trade-off is empirically determined to be $0.6^\circ$, slightly larger than $\theta_{3dB}$.\\
The result of applying the correction to the TCR at 673 m is displayed in panels (c) and (f) of \autoref{fig:tcr_mph}; the phase ramp is significantly reduced while the azimuth resolution is slightly degraded. However, the observed azimuth resolution is still smaller than $0.6^\circ$, the value that would be observed if the samples were to be summed incoherently, without accounting for the phase ramp. This result hints again that  most of the phase ramp has been removed by the proposed method.\\
Similar results are observed for all reflector, as displayed in \autoref{fig:phase_response_VV:corrected}.  After the correction, only the reflector at 74 m shows a large residual azimuth phase variation; this behavior is attributed to its closeness to the radar relative to the far field transition distance of the antennas, in the order of 500 m. Excluding this exception, the residual variation is under $10^\circ$ for samples inside the antenna beamwidth.

\subsection{Antenna Pattern Misalingment}
\begin{figure}[ht!]

	\caption{Azimuth power response of a dihedral corner reflector, before and after the correction of antenna pattern mispointing. The observed gain is in line with the expected power loss due to the H and V patterns not perfectly overlapping.}
	\label{fig:hv_power}
\end{figure}
To verify the impact of the $H$-$V$ pattern pointing shift as described in \autoref{sec:misalingment} on the performance of crosspolar measurements, the response of a dihedral reflector with an high crosspolar contribution is analyzed for two configurations:\\ \begin{enumerate*}\item the case where the antennas are not mechanically moved \item the case where the optimal shift of 1.8 mm is applied to bring the patterns into alignment.\\ 
\end{enumerate*}
In \autoref{fig:hv_power}, the result of the above experiment is shown as the oversampled, coregistered azimuth response in the $HV$ channel; a gain of approx. 2.5 dB is observed after correcting for the pattern misalignment. The estimated gain is very close to the one expected by analyzing the provided antenna patterns. This results confirms that the 1.8 mm shift setting employed to acquire the calibration data can correctly compensate the crosspolar power lost and the $HH-VV$ misregistration.

\subsection{Polarimetric Calibration}\label{sec:res_polcal}

	]{../tab/table_3.csv}
	\caption{Copolar phase and amplitude imbalance computed on the reflectors using the calibrated dataset. The polarization purity (VV/HV ratio) is shown additionally. Results for the reflector used to determine calibration parameters are not shown.}
	\label{tab:polcal}
\end{table}		
The methods described in the preceding sections were applied to prepare SLC images for each channel. For the final polarimetric calibration the procedure of \autoref{sec:proc_polcal} was used; one reflector in the scene was used as a calibration target, with the four remaining reflectors used for the determination of the calibration performance.\\
An initial assessment of the data quality is made  by computing polarization signatures\cite{VanZyl1987} for two of the five corner reflectors that were not used to determine the calibration parameters. They are plotted in \autoref{fig:signatures}.
The signature for the uncorrected data does not correspond to the signatures of any basic scattering mechanism. In the calibrated response, both reflectors show a correspondence with the expected polarization signature for trihedral reflectors.\\
\begin{figure*}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figure_8}
	\caption{Dependence of the residual copolar phase and amplitude imbalances on the local incidence angle. The mean and RMS imbalances are shown in each plot. The data point at $0^\circ$ represents the reflector at 73 m, where the geocoding procedure used to compute the incidence angle map did not deliver the correct angle.}
	\label{fig:inc_angle_trend}
\end{figure*}
A quantitative evaluation of the calibration is obtained by estimating the residual copolar phase and amplitude imbalances $f$ and $\phi_r + \phi_t$ on the trihedral from calibrated data, excluding the reflector used to determine the parameter. The results are shown in \autoref{tab:polcal}. Generally, both the amplitude and the phase imbalance appear to be well corrected. The mean residual for $f$ is 0.97 with an RMS of 0.05. Similarly, for the residual phase difference a mean of $4^\circ$ is observed, with a RMS of $7^\circ$. The biggest outlier for $f$ is represented by the reflector very close to the radar, at 73 m slant range. As previously discussed, it is not located sufficiently far away to be in the far field region of the antennas; this could explain the discrepancy from the rest of the array.
In \autoref{fig:inc_angle_trend}, the dependence of the residuals on the local incidence angle is plotted; no clear trend can be distinguished, however it is rather difficult to judge this observation given the small number of data points available and the rather limited extent of covered incidence angles. However, given the small RMS and mean residual errors, the choice of a model that does not consider variation of calibration parameters with incidence angle appears to be justified. The absence of clear incidence-angle related trends is also seen as hinting the appropriateness of the method proposed in \autoref{sec:proc_polcal} to remove the topographic contribution from the polarimetric phase differences; larger variation would be otherwise observed.\\
The assumption of negligible crosstalk seems plausible considering that all reflectors  except the very far one show a polarization purity above 35 dB. In the former case, the combination of large azimuth resolution cell size, the relatively low RCS of the TCR and  the difficulty of exactly pointing it towards the radar may have lowered the purity because of a larger influence of clutter in the cell.
