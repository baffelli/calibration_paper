\subsection{Beam Squint Correction}\label{sec:discussion:squint_correction}
%The effect of correcting the frequency-dependent beam squint is not easily visible in the SLC data displayed in \autoref{fig:scene_mph}. Therefore, in the rest of this section the response of single features in the scene will be analyzed.
The effect of the frequency squint on the raw data around TCR "Hindere Chlapf" is visible in \autoref{fig:raw_squint}, panels (a) and (b) for the HH and VV channels. As described in 
\autoref{sec:methods:squint_correction} and sketched in \autoref{fig:squint_correction}, the data matrix appears skewed:  the physical antenna direction and the effective pointing angle of the beam pattern only match for a brief time during each chirp due to the frequency scanning of the antenna. Because of that, if the data is range compressed, only part of the chirp bandwidth illuminates the target at each time, reducing the observed range resolution. This is verified in \autoref{fig:tcr_mph} subfigures (a) and (c), where the oversampled response of TCR "Hindere Chlapf" after range compression is shown.\\
The linear squint factor $a$ estimated on all reflectors of the calibration array is given in \autoref{tab:a_squint_fit};
the average estimated values of 4 and 3.9 $\frac{\circ}{GHz}$  fit well with the figures suggested by the antenna manufacturer: 4.2 and 3.9 $\frac{\circ}{GHz}$ for the H and V antennas respectively.\\
Thanks to the oversampled acquisition it is possible to use the proposed interpolation method to realign the samples in azimuth, compensating the effect of the squint by combining subsequent sub-chirps with different squint angles in a single coherent chirp that covers the entire bandwidth for the whole duration of time when the target is within the antenna beamwidth. This is shown in \autoref{fig:raw_squint} panels (b) and (d). The result of the interpolation is visible in \autoref{fig:raw_squint}, panels (c) and (d): the spectrum is now aligned in azimuth; as a consequence the range resolution is decreased, as visible in \autoref{fig:tcr_mph}. Additionally the phase response seems to become more stable.
Visually, the phase pattern observed in (a) and (c) is also removed entirely; however, a residual azimuthal phase can be observed in the VV channel in (e).
\subsection{Azimuth Processing}\label{sec:discussion:azimuth_processing}
The residual phase ramp observed on the "Hindere Chlapf" reflector in \autoref{sec:discussion:squint_correction} is not unique to that object:\\ A linear variation of 30 degrees over the 3dB antenna beamwidth can be observed for all reflectors in the dataset, as plotted in \autoref{fig:phase_response_VV:uncorrected}.  The model of \autoref{sec:methods:azimuth_processing} was developed to explain this variation in terms of the acquisition geometry.
The estimated phase center location values $\hat{L_{ph}}$ of \autoref{tab:rph_fit} are consistent and display a standard deviation of less than 2 \% of the antenna length, suggesting that the model is able to predict most of the phase variation. The estimated phase center shift for the H unit $\hat{L}_{ph}^{H}$ is less than -5 cm, wile the one for the V antenna, $\hat{L}_{ph}^{V}$, is 12 cm, almost twice as large and with opposite sign. This difference presumably explains the visibility of the azimuthal phase ramp in the VV channel:\\
For a specific target,  $\theta_r$ is limited to the time where it is inside the antenna beamwidth, $\theta_{3dB}$. This small value would not produce any appreciable phase variation. However for increasing values of $L_{ph}$, the entire function of \autoref{eq:range_phase} is rapidly shifted  by a large $\alpha$, simulating the effect of a larger $\theta_r$, as it would be obtained with a much bigger antenna beamwidth.\\
As shown in panel (g) of \autoref{fig:tcr_mph}, the azimuth phase variation is significantly reduced by the proposed correction method, while the azimuth resolution is slightly degraded, while still being less than $0.6^\circ$, the value that would be expected if the samples were to be incoherently integrated. This result hints again that most of the phase ramp has been removed by the proposed method.\\
Similar results are observed for all trihedral reflectors, summarized in \autoref{fig:phase_response_VV:corrected}.  Generally, the HH data shows a much smaller variation, while the VV phase displays an almost linear increase of 30$^\circ$. As expected from the estimated phase center locations of \autoref{tab:rph_fit}, the observed phase slopes for the V and H have opposite signs.\\  After the correction, only the reflector "Chutzen" shows a large residual azimuth phase variation; its closeness to the radar relative to the far field transition distance of the antennas in the order of 500 m could explain the discrepancy: a non-linear  phase variation is already observed before the correction. Excluding this exception, the residual variation is under $5^\circ$ for samples inside the antenna beamwidth, marked by vertical lines in the plot.
\subsection{Antenna Pattern Misalignment}\label{sec:discussion:misalignment}
Correcting for the estimated pattern alignment results in a gain of approx. 2.5 dB  in HV power with respect to the uncompensated reference case, as plotted in \autoref{fig:hv_power}. The estimated gain is very close to the one expected by analyzing the patterns provided by the antenna manufacturer. This results confirms that the 1.8 mm shift setting employed to acquire the calibration data can correctly compensate the crosspolar power loss and the HH-VV misregistration.
\subsection{Removal of Topographic Phase}
The effect of the topographic phase compensation as described in \autoref{sec:methods:topo_removal} is quite dramatic;
before the correction, fringes are clearly visible, particularly in the near range (\autoref{fig:topo_phase:uncorrected}). An estimate of this contribution is obtained from the unwrapped and rescaled interferogram between the upper and the lower HH channels. Because the are separated by a spatial baseline and they employ the same polarization (as seen in \autoref{fig:antenna_arrangement}), this interferogram provides an estimate of the topographic phase without additional polarimetric phase differences. The estimated topographic phase is then subtracted from the covariance matrix; the resulting flattened copolar phase difference is displayed in \autoref{fig:topo_phase:corrected}. Visually, it appears free of topographic contributions; at this point the data is ready to be employed for polarimetric calibration.
\subsection{Polarimetric Calibration}
An illustration of the effect of the calibration procedure of \autoref{sec:methods:proc_polcal} is given in  \autoref{fig:signatures} by the polarization signatures of two reflectors before and after the calibration.
The signature for the uncorrected data does not correspond to the signatures of any basic scattering mechanism. In the calibrated response, both reflectors show a correspondence with the expected polarization signature for trihedral reflectors.\\ The dramatic change in shape of the signatures is mainly to be attributed to the correction of the HH-VV phase, which shows a significant offset after the removal of the topographic contribution. By using a trihedral corner reflector or a similar scatterer, this offset is estimated and removed.\\
This interpretation is supported by the residual imbalance estimates in \autoref{tab:polcal}.
Both amplitude and  phase imbalances appear to be well corrected; the mean residual for the amplitude imbalance $f$ is 1.03 with an root mean square deviation of 0.05. A mean of $1.19^\circ$ is observed for the copolar phase imbalance $\phi_r + \phi_t$ , with a root mean square deviation of $7^\circ$. The biggest outlier for $f$ is represented by reflector "Chutzen", placed very close to the radar, at 73 m slant range. As previously discussed, it is not located sufficiently far away to be in the far field region of the antennas; this could explain the discrepancy from the rest of the array. In the case of the copolar phase imbalance $\phi_r + \phi_t$, the results appear to be correlated with the polarization purity of each reflector; the largest outlier being the farthest TCR, "T\"{u}rle". This is the target with the smallest estimated purity; which likely implies larger clutter contributions in the resolution cell, which would increase the phase bias.\\
The assumption of negligible crosstalk seems plausible considering that almost all reflectors exhibit polarization purities above 35 dB, the same reasons discussed above could explain the difference observed for  "T\"{u}rle".
No clear trend for $f$ and $\phi_r + \phi_t$ residuals as a function of incidence angle is observed (\autoref{fig:inc_angle_trend}); nevertheless a clear judgment is difficult given the small number of data points available and the limited extent of incidence angles covered. However, given the small RMS and mean residual errors, the choice of a model that does not consider variation of calibration parameters with incidence angle appears to be justified. The absence of distinct incidence-angle related trends also suggests the validity of the method proposed in \autoref{sec:methods:proc_polcal} for the estimation and removal of the topographic contribution from the polarimetric phase differences.\\
