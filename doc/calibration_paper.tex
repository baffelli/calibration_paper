\begin{abstract}
Differential interferometry using ground-based radar systems permits to monitor fast displacements in natural terrain with a high degree of flexibility in terms of the choice of location, time of acquisition and revisit time. In combination with polarimetric imaging, discrimination of different scattering mechanisms present in a resolution cell can be obtained while estimating the surface displacement.
In this paper we present the pre-processing steps and the calibration procedure required to produce high-quality calibrated polarimetric single-look complex imagery with KAPRI, a portable Ku-band polarimetric radar interferometer (built by Gamma Remote Sensing). The system uses the deramp-on-receive FMCW architecture for ranging, angular resolution is obtained by a large slotted waveguide antenna with an azimuth 3dB beamwidth of $0.4^\circ$. The processing of KAPRI data into SLC images is addressed, including the correction of beam squint and of azimuthal phase variations. A polarimetric calibration model adapted to the acquisition mode is presented, that is used to produce calibrated polarimetric covariance matrix data. The methods are tested on a validation dataset of a scene containing five trihedral corner reflectors. The data processing is assessed by analyzing the oversampled response of a corner reflector, the polarimetric calibration quality is verified by computing polarimetric signatures and residual calibration parameters, which show a RMS HHVV phase imbalance under $7^\circ$ after the calibration.
